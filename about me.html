                          Hello! My name is Dan Narcis Costinel, and I am a second-year student 
                          at the <b>FACULTY OF AUTOMATIC CONTROL AND COMPUTER SCIENCE</b>, part of the National University 
                          of Science and Technology Bucharest, specializing in <b>SYSTEMS ENGINEERING</b>.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p id="desc2">
                          Since middle school, I have developed a passion for mathematics, being drawn to the fact that 
                          solving problems required <b>ANALYTICAL THINKING</b> and a bit of creativity. I have always liked 
                          leaving my mark on what I do, so in high school, I chose the <b>MATHEMATICS-INFORMATICS</b> profile, 
                          where I discovered that I enjoy computer science as it helps me further develop my 
                          <b>ANALYTICAL THINKING IN RESOLVING COMPLEX PROBLEMS</b>.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p id="desc3">
                          In 12th grade, I started questioning myself: <i>What faculty do I want to attend?</i>, 
                          <i>What would I like to do in the future?</i>, 
                          <i>If I were to continue with mathematics and computer science, what options do I have?</i>. 
                          I decided to pursue the field of automation because I want to learn about their 
                          <b>APPLICATION</b> in everyday life, and the field of systems engineering allows me to achieve this.
                        </p> <br>
                        <p id="desc4">
                          My studies in the field of <b>AUTOMATION</b> and the subjects I have taken so far have given me 
                          a deeper understanding of this vast domain, confirming that I made the <b>RIGHT CHOICE</b> 
                          by enrolling in this faculty. I aspire to develop my career in this field, contributing to 
                          innovative and efficient solutions in the future.
