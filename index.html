                        to deepen my knowledge in applied computer science and systems engineering. 
                        Although the admission process and the baccalaureate exam were significant challenges,

                <li> <b id="title-movies-books"> Passion for movies && books</b></li>
                <p id="description-movies-books"> I am passionate about movies and series, especially those in the science fiction and psychological
                    genres. Recently, I discovered a newfound love for reading, sparked by a series based on a book 
                    collection (Shadowhunters). The impact of this show was so profound that it ignited my curiosity to delve deeper 
                    into the story through books (The Mortal Instruments). This experience has helped me appreciate the complexity and richness that literature offers.</p> <br>
                
                <li> <b id="title-explore"> Passion for exploration && socialization</b> </li>
                <p id="description-explore"> I enjoy traveling and discovering new places, whether it's breathtaking natural landscapes or 
                    remarkable cultural landmarks. Nature inspires me, and spending time admiring scenic views or 
                    walking through parks is a source of peace and energy for me. <br>
                    Additionally, I value quality time with friends, whether it involves going out or simply enjoying each other's company.</p>  <br>

                <li> <b id="title-programming"> Passion for programming && creativity</b></li> 
                <p id="description-programming"> For me, programming is more than just a technical skill â€” it's a way to express my creativity and 
                    develop algorithmic thinking. I enjoy engaging in projects where I can leave my personal mark and 
                    contribute to innovative solutions. The continuous learning process in this field keeps me motivated 
                    to experiment and discover new things constantly. <br>
                    I have programmed the most in C/C++, a language that attracted me due to its ability to directly manipulate
                    memory and create robust, efficient programs. Even though it is considered a challenging language, this complexity 
                    has helped me develop a heightened attention to detail when writing code, allowing me to address potential errors early 
                    in the development process. My experience with C/C++ has strengthened my understanding of programming fundamentals and 
                    prepared me to tackle complex problems in a structured way.</p>
